**1. Read in the nhefs.sas7bdat file from the EPI 289 course website.**

```{r, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Load packages to read in SAS file and perform analysis
library(sas7bdat)
library(dplyr)
library(plotrix)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
# Read in SAS file
df <- read.sas7bdat("C:/Users/Me/Dropbox/4. HSPH MPH 45.5 QM/6. Spring 1/EPI289/HW/nhefs.sas7bdat")

**2. Sort the data set by the variable seqn. Print out the ID number,** 
**age, and sex for the first 10 observations.**  

```{r}
# Sort by seqn. Select seqn, sex & age. Print top 10.
df %>% 
  arrange((seqn)) %>%
  select(seqn, sex, age) %>% 
  head(10)
```

**3.Find the mean systolic blood pressure and standard error for men and for women.**

```{r}
# Group by sex and print mean and standard error excluding any NAs.
# 0-male, 1-female
df %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarize(mean_size= mean(sbp, na.rm=TRUE), 
            standard_error= std.error(sbp, na.rm=TRUE))
```

**4. What is the mean, 25th percentile, 50th percentile, 75th percentile,** 
**and interquartile range of weight in 1971 (in kilograms).**

```{r}
# Print mean, 25th percentile, 50th percentile, 75th percentile and IQR for 
# 1971 weight in Kg
df %>% 
  select(wt71) %>%
  summarize(IQR=IQR(wt71))
  
df %>% 
  select(wt71) %>%
  summary()
```

**5a.In your data step, create quartiles for weight in 1971 as based on the**
**cut-points from Question (4). Give a tabulation of your results.**

```{r}
# Create quartiles based on question 4 results and tabulate results
df %>% mutate(quartiles= case_when(wt71 <= 59.65 ~ "1",
                                   wt71 <= 69.40 ~ "2",
                                   wt71 <= 79.95 ~ "3",
                                   wt71 <= 169.19 ~ "4")) %>% 
  count(Quartiles=quartiles)

# Save quartiles in dataframe
df<-df %>% mutate(quartiles= case_when(wt71 <= 59.65 ~ "1",
                                   wt71 <= 69.40 ~ "2",
                                   wt71 <= 79.95 ~ "3",
                                   wt71 <= 169.19 ~ "4"))
```

**5b. Create quartiles for weight in 1971 using PROC RANK.**
**Give a tabulation of your results. Do your results match those of Question (5a)?**
**Why or why not?**

```{r}
# There is no PROC RANK funciton in R so I simulated the funciton based
# on the referenced link below.

df$rank <- rank(df$wt71)
percent.rank<-function(x) trunc(rank(x)/length(x)*100)
df<-within(df,pr<-percent.rank(rank))
df$bins <- cut(df$pr, breaks=c(-Inf,25,50,75,+Inf), labels=c("1","2","3","4"))

df %>% count(Quartiles=bins)

```

If we look closely the percentile rank function is truncating (rounding) 
downwards. That is a value of 0.06 will be a percentile rank of 0. Therefore it
is possible that values on the limits between percentile ranks, eg. 59.6 will be
rounded to 59 rather than 60.

On the other hand if we remove this condition we get results which are similar
to the first tabulation using the quartiles:

Quartiles    n
1	          406			
2	          408			
3	          408			
4	          407	

However we still suffer from "rounding" off differences, but to a lesser extent.

That said please note that since R doesn't have a PROC RANK function I 
attempted to simualte it as described here:

(PROC_RANK_IN_R)[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33253583/grouped-ranking-in-r]

**6. 	Using PROC REG, fit a univariate linear regression model for the** 
**outcome weight in 1971 with number of cigarettes smoked per day in 1971**
**as the predictor. Report the parameter estimate for cigarettes smoked per day.** 

```{r}
# Fit linear model for weight in 1971 and cigarettes smoked per day in 1971
fit_q6 <- df %>%  
  lm(wt71 ~ smokeintensity, 
     data=.)

summary(fit_q6)
```

The parameter estimate for cigraettes smoked per day is: 0.11275

**7. Create a cross-tabulation between sex and race.**

```{r}
# Cross tabulation between sex and race
# Sex: 0-male, 1-female; Race: 0-white, 1-black or other
table(df$sex, 
      df$race)
```

**8. Using PROC REG, fit a multivariate linear regression model for the outcome** 
**weight in  1971 with age, sex, and race as the predictors. From this model,** 
**print the observed and predicted values of weight in 1971 for the first 5**
**observations. What is the predicted value of weight in 1971 for an individual** 
**of age 40, female, and of Black or other race/ethnicity?**

```{r}
# Fit multilinear model for y=weight in 1971 & x= age, sex, and race
fit_q8 <- df %>%  
  lm(wt71 ~ 
       age + 
       sex + 
       race, 
     data=.)

summary(fit_q8)

# Print the observed and predicted values of weight in 1971 for first 5 rows
df2<-data.frame(Id= df$seqn, 
                Age= df$age, 
                Sex= df$sex, 
                Race= df$race, 
                Predicted_Weight=fitted(fit_q8))
df2 %>% head(5)

# Predicted value of weight in 1971 for an individual of age 40, female and 
# black or other race/ethnicity

Prediction=77.098741-(0.006316*40)-(12.748300*1)+(5.502288*1)
Prediction
```

**9. Fit the same model from Question (8) using PROC GLM and compare your** 
**results. Use the CLASS statement to adjust for any categorical variables.**

```{r}
# Repeat question 9 using GLM
fit_q9 <- df %>%  
  glm(wt71 ~ 
        age + 
        as.factor(sex) + 
        as.factor(race),
      data=.,
      gaussian(link = "identity"))

print("GLM Results")
summary(fit_q9)
print("Linear Model Results")
summary(fit_q8)
```

The results do not differ between question 8 and 9.

"```lm``` fits models of the form: ```Y = XB + e``` where e~Normal( 0, s2 ).
```glm``` fits models of the form: ```g(Y) = XB + e```, where the function g() 
and the sampling distribution of e need to be specified."

**10. Using PROC LOGISTIC, fit a multivariate logistic regression model for** 
**the outcome asthma diagnosis in 1971 with age, sex, race, and usual physical** 
**activity status (var active) as the predictors. Print the predicted**
**probabilities of asthma diagnosis for the individuals with the** 
**first 5 ID numbers.**

```{r}
# Multivariate logistic regression of asthma dx in 1971 ~ age,sex,rave and 
# usual physical activity 
fit_q10 <- df %>%  
  glm(asthma ~ 
        age + 
        as.factor(sex) + 
        as.factor(race)+
        active,
      data=., 
      binomial(link = "logit"))

summary(fit_q10)

# Print the observed and predicted values of weight in 1971 for first 5 rows
df3<- data.frame(Id= df$seqn, 
                Age= df$age, 
                Sex= df$sex, 
                Race= df$race,
                Activity= df$active,
                Predicted_asthma_probaility=fitted(fit_q10))
df3 %>% head(5)
```

**11. (Optional) Create a graph that plots systolic blood pressure on the**
**Y-axis and usual physical activity status (var active) on the X-axis.**

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Define a color scheme for active groups 
# 0-very active 1-moderate activity 2-inactive
df<-df %>% mutate(color_scheme= case_when(active %in% 0 ~ "blue",
                                      active %in% 1 ~ "red",
                                      active %in% 2 ~ "green"))

df %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(as.factor(active),sbp, fill=color_scheme), alpha=0.5) +
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position="none")+
  labs(subtitle="Boxplot of SBP vs Physical Activity",
      x="Physical activity", 
       y="Systolic blood pressure") 
  
```
